The problem we tried to solve was Bramptons lack of rental bikes.



We realized that before Brampton partner with a bikeshare they would first need to gather data

from the community on where best to place these rideshares. On the Brampton Open Data

there is no information about potential location, or ridership in neighbourhoods.



Our solution is a QR code that can be applied to posters around the city, such as at bike stops,

shops, places of business, and Go stations. The QR code contains information on where in the city

it is located, and upon scanning the code the user will be directed to a 15 second survey where

we will ask them where they would like to see a bikeshare in their community. It uses OpenMaps

API, alongside our own custom NodeJS and mySQL implementation to store the data.



This data will then be passed on to the city make informed decisions.



One of the most important thrusts for our idea is that it is very low cost to the city to implement, and

it gives very granular data about ridership, but is also scalable.



We recommend a pilot program and have also simulated some data showcasing what the feedback may look like,

which you can find in our powerpoint presentation.
